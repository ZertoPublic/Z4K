# Taints and Tolerations
	
Z4K supports taints and tolerations configuration for nodes and pods.

You can add a node annotation called “zertorole” to force VRA installation behaviour.

-	Add the value “worker” to force VRA installation.
-	Add the value “master” to force skipping VRA installation.

#### Adding and Updating Zertorole Annotation

-	To force VRA installation, add or update the annotation on the current node with the command:

```
kubectl annotate node <node-name> --overwrite zertorole=worker
```
	
-	To skip VRA installation, add or update the annotation on the current node with the command:
	
```
kubectl annotate node <node-name> --overwrite zertorole=master
```

<span class="Note">Note: Use --overwrite to update an annotation that already exists.</span>

#### Removing Zertorole Annotation

To remove a zertorole annotation use a minus - sign at the end of the annotation:

```
kubectl annotate node <node-name> zertorole-
```

<span class="Note">Note: Nodes that are tainted with a taint that does not allow VRA installation ("NoSchedule" effect) cannot have it's deployments protected.</span>
	
-	Taints and tolerations are not replicated.
-	When Taints and Tolerations are in use they must be predefined in pods and nodes for VPG protection, **before** recovery oeprations take place.
